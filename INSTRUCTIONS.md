This is a simple instructions file for my plugin.

My plugin is not something special, since i had no clue on where to start with machines, but i always wanted to do lasers in Minecraft.

So there isn't much functionality (didn't know what to add), but if you place down a piston and right click it with a stick it will emit a laser. The laser will pass trough non-occluding block and stop when it reaches them. But if it hits a dropper, the dropper will redirect the laser into the direction it is pointing at (the dropper). When the laser is turned on, the first distance travelled by the beam is stored and if at any point later before the laser is stopped, the distance travelled changes, the laser will emit an alert sound. So it basically calibrates when you turn it on. You can turn it of by right clicking again. There is also a different laser, which is a right click with a blaze rod, but that one doesnt use droppers, but bounces off of iron blocks, like a laser pointer would. Also if you shift right click a dispenser it will toggle the laser to invisible or vice-versa.

Thats basically it, there isn't much, as i had no ideas on what to do :P
